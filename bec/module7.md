# P68: Management consultants 管理顾问

Dear Editor
亲爱的编辑

Your article on 5 September 'Consultants -- who needs them?' gives a very
one-sided view of our profession.
您在9月5日刊出的文章《顾问——谁需要他们？》对我们所从事的职业给出了一个非常片面的看法。

As consultants, we are often criticised for using management buzzwords
to sell our services. The critics' **argument** is that we dress up an
old concept and present it to companies as a revolutionary idea that
will **transform** their business. So when we encourage companies to
'analyse their value chain', we are saying nothing more than 'see
which part of the business is more profitable'. When we **urge**
them to 'empower their employees', we are just saying **trust**
them to do a good job. The terms we use, the critics say, is just
jargon for things that all businesses know they have to do anyway.
作为顾问，我们经常因为使用管理术语出售我们的服务而受到批评。
批评者的论点是我们把陈旧的概念包装成一个革命性的概念兜售给公司用于变革其生意。
所以，当我们鼓励公司“分析他们的价值链”时，我们只说“看哪一部分生意更有利可图”。
当我们强烈要求他们“授权给员工”时，我们只是说“信任他们会把工作做好”。
批评者说，我们使用的术语只不过是所有企业都已经知道的他们必须要做的事情的行话。

We're also accused **of** hypocrisy. The classic example of this
is when during the 1990s consultancy firms told companies to
concentrate on their core competencies and outsource non-essential
activities to contractors who could do a better and cheaper job.
But, the critics scream, you **spent** a lot of the early 1980s
telling companies to diversify and get involved in new businesses.
我们也被指责为虚伪。
这方面的典型例子是，在20世纪90年代，咨询公司要求企业集中精力于核心竞争力，将非必要活动外包给能够做得更好、更便宜的承包商。
但是，批评人士尖叫道，你却在20世纪80年代早期花了很多时间告诉公司要经营多元化和开展新的业务。

Maybe we are sometimes guilty of following the **latest** trends in
management, but I have one **very** simple answer for the critics.
Knowing the need for these management concepts and practices is one
thing; actually using them and **implementting** them is another. Our job
is to remind businesses to do the things they ought to be doing.
That is the role of consultants and it's a very **useful** role.
We're not saying managers are stupid, but just that it's human
nature sometimes to ignore the obvious.
也许我们有时会因为紧随管理的最新趋势而感到内疚，但我有一个非常简单的答案给批评者。
了解这些管理概念和实践的需求是一回事；实际使用和实现它们则是另一回事。
我们的工作是提醒企业做他们应该做的事情。
这是顾问的角色，也是非常有用的角色。
我们并不是说管理者是愚蠢的，而是说忽视显而易见的事情是人的本性。
